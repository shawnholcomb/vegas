                    for everyone to be in Vegas Friday evening so that we can meet up and coordinate plans for the weekend
                    but we understand that schedules can be hectic and ask that everyone do their best. If anyone wants
                    to get to Vegas earlier that is always an option and people can meet up and make lodging
                    arrangements together if they like. We will leave this up to everyone individually to decide.</p>

                    least expensive Spirit/Frontier flights up to an average of $350 for major airlines. Keep in mind
                    that the cheapest flight may not include carry-on or luggage costs so there may be additional fees. Average flight time for direct flights is about 3 hours but Vegas is Pacific Time so you
                    will gain two hours on the way there. We are having everyone book their own flights so they can
                    travel to Vegas at whichever dates/times are most convenient. If you want to travel with other

                <h2 class="section-header">Hotel</h2>
                <p class="body-text">The plan is to stay on the strip. There are a number of hotels in the middle that
                    will put us within walking distance of almost anywhere we will want to go. After getting input from
                    some of the Vegas vetrans and checking prices of nearly twenty hotels we narrowed down the field to
                    the choices below. We will discuss these options in the <strong>#league-news</strong> channel on
                    Discord and take a vote as we normally do.</p>
                <p class="body-text">There are a few items to discuss with the hotel that differ this year from the way we
                    typically do things. Since we are staying in hotels we need to figure the room situation. After
                    looking into it, hotels don't do block rentals with anything less than ten rooms so this isn't an
                    option for us. We will need three or four rooms depending on whether people want to do two people per room
                    or four (two beds, two per room as a way to save money.) There is also the option of a hybrid (two
                    rooms with double-occupancy, one room with four people.) Because there are multiple options we want to
                    determine which hotel we will all stay at, have everyone decide whom they are lodging with and then
                    individual groups will book their rooms. Once all of the rooms are booked we will reach out to the
                    hotel and see if we are able to get the rooms adjacent, or at least on the same floor. We will reach
                    out to everyone to see what their preferences are and try to help coordinate to make this as
                    seamless as possible but feel free to reach out to other league members that you might want to room with.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Hotels in Vegas include resort fees and taxes so there may be some slight price
                    differences from what is posted below but I tried to calculate everything directly through the
                    hotels websites to be as accurate as possible. A number of these prices include some current
                    discounts and promotions that are valid through mid-June so the sooner we can make a decision the
                    more money we can possibly save. Another note, we did look into booking through third-party groups
                    and the prices aren't considerably lower and there is less opportunity for saving once we are there.
                    Once we decide on a hotel I would also recommend signing up for the rewards program through the
                    hotel. These are free and can offer discounts on the rooms or restaurants, etc. at the hotel,
                    especially once we start gambling in the casinos. Another note, many of the hotels only require about 
                    thirty percent of the room cost to make a reservation and the rest is paid once you check in or out so the initial booking isn't actually that expensive. Feel free
                    to reach out with any questions. It
                    would be preferable that we discuss this in Discord so everyone has access to all of the questions
                    and discussion that we cover.</p>

                                <p>Location and rooms look good, but that is really the case for all of these spots. This place was remodeled recently.  The
                                    pool here is on the small side. The casino looks a little crappy. It looks like to be on the small side and has an airport vibe but it is the least expensive option.</p>

                                <p>This one is interesting, it's a 21+ hotel, which is good for shenanigans. It's super
                                    swanky though and may seem more like a spot for couples. The pool is on the roof and
                                    looks dope, though it's on the small side. This is a newer spot and looks it, for
                                    what that's worth.</p>

                                <p>MGM Grand seems to be the gold standard when it comes to the actual casino area but the other
                                    amenities are dope too. This one seems like the best bang for the buck. They
                                    have a promotion going on at the moment which makes it more affordable as it was $320
                                    per person a couple weeks ago when I checked.</p>

                    a meeting room at the hotel and doing a boardroom style draft. A few requests have been sent out to
                    determine what type of cost is involved in doing this. The idea of having everyone rock suits in the
                    boardroom has been introduced and will be discussed further in the <strong>#league-news</strong>
                    channel on Discord. Once we determine which hotel we are staying at we will also contact them
                    directly to confirm their pricing. The fallback plan is simply to draft in one of the hotel rooms.
                    This would present a free option if the boardroom option is too expensive.</p>
